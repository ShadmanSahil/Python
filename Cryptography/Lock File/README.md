Allows users to:

- register
- login
- lock/unlock a file

through voice commands if necessary, all by ensuring that their passwords, and hence the code locking their files, are encrypted and stored in a file.

# For encryption and decryption, I have used self written codes of Caesar cipher, vigenere and RSA.

# I have also used Euclidean Algorithm for the RSA decryption.

# For voice commands, I have used speech_recognition module.

# I have also used PyPDF2 module to read the file.



My codes are divided for better understanding. File main.py contains the final code.
